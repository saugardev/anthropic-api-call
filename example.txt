--------------------------------
Based on the extraction goals to get the name and title of the talk from the email, I'll create a JSON structure with regex patterns to extract this information:

```json
{
  "values": [
    {
      "name": "speaker_name",
      "parts": [
        {
          "is_public": false,
          "regex_def": "Hi "
        },
        {
          "is_public": true,
          "regex_def": "[^,]+"
        },
        {
          "is_public": false,
          "regex_def": ","
        }
      ],
      "location": "body",
      "maxLength": 100
    },
    {
      "name": "talk_title",
      "parts": [
        {
          "is_public": false,
          "regex_def": "your proposal \""
        },
        {
          "is_public": true,
          "regex_def": "[^\"]*"
        },
        {
          "is_public": false,
          "regex_def": "\""
        }
      ],
      "location": "body", 
      "maxLength": 200
    }
  ]
}
```

This structure will:

1. Extract the speaker's name:
- Matches after "Hi " and before the comma
- Captures the full name as public content
- Maximum length of 100 characters to accommodate long names

2. Extract the talk title:
- Matches between the quotes after "your proposal"
- Captures the entire title as public content
- Maximum length of 200 characters to accommodate long titles

The patterns are:
- Continuous in the email content
- Specific enough to avoid false matches
- Split appropriately between public/private parts
- Located in the email body
- Include clear boundaries (comma, quotes)

The regex patterns will extract:
- Name: "Aayush Gupta"
- Title: "The Signature Singularity: How Signed Data Standards Unlock Web Portability and Pseudonymity"
